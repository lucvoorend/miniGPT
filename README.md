# miniGPT
Single character based miniGPT based on the tutorial by Andrej Karpathy. The miniGPT is trained on a dataset containing all the lyrics of the Dutch sing and song writers "Acda en de Munnik". A [webscraper](https://github.com/lucvoorend/miniGPT/blob/main/webscraper.ipynb) is added to the repository which is used to create the dataset. The [dataset](https://github.com/lucvoorend/miniGPT/blob/main/acda_en_de_munnik_lyrics.txt) itself is also added. The model definition for the transformer can be found in in [model.py](https://github.com/lucvoorend/miniGPT/blob/main/model.py). The [script for training](https://github.com/lucvoorend/miniGPT/blob/main/train.py) is also added to the repo. 

This model is not meant as a perfect GPT for generating song lyrics. Rather, it is meant as a practice exercise, familiarizing yourself with the concept of generative transformers on a custom dataset.
